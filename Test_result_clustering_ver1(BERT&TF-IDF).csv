Narciso Rodriguez For Her was launched in 2003. Narciso Rodriguez For Her was created by Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are African Orange flower, Osmanthus and Bergamot; middle notes are Musk and Amber; base notes are Vetiver, Vanille and Patchouli. This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2004 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007.Young and very modern American designer of Cuban origins Narciso Rodriguez has launched his first fragrances which has instantly become the hit in the US, and not only there. The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle.
At first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods – patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer. The creators of these fragrances are Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian.

Secret was created by in-house perfumer Jean-Michel Duriez. Secret de Rochas Oud Mystère was launched in 2014, and in 2015 we have a new edition called Secret de Rochas Rose Intense.

According to Jean-Michel Duriez, Secret de Rochas Rose Intense highlights sensuality of a woman and offers new insight into her indefinable allure, inspired by Parisian joie de vivre and audacity. ""I wanted to create a boudoir atmosphere for this fragrance. A woman’s boudoir is the one private room that is all her own, a place where she keeps all her secrets – fragrance, beauty and otherwise. It offers the perfect inspiration for Secret de Rochas Rose Intense as this special place is the quintessence of female sensuality and mystique.” 
The main note of the composition is May rose. “This special rose is indeed different than other roses; it has a fresher, more natural scent. The flower is a little bit fragile, but the elegant and delicate scent is unique in the world of perfumery”, said the perfumer. It is mixed with fruity accords of passion fruit and peach on the top. Red rose, rose leaf, osmanthus and secret ingredient form the heart of the perfume. Amber, moss, patchouli and musk notes end up in the base.

Secret de Rochas Rose Intense shares the distinctive packaging of the original. While the keyhole-shaped bottle remains the same, the round, hand-made coffret, is given a rose hue evoking the vibrant shade of the rose de Mai. The juice is an intense rose color as well. 
The fragrance is available as 100 ml Eau de Parfum.

This woman lives on in my memory, to the point of obsession: her perfume, SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier. The very essence of a scandal.
Orange blossom, so bright, Sambac jasmine so opulent and tuberose so powdery: a threesome of white flowers that one could have sworn would deliver an angelic sweetness.
And boom! It’s a bomb of all that is sensual!
Juicy raspberry, a gourmetmilkiness with sexy undertones presses all the carnal buttons. A simple aphrodisiac, a deadly weapon that’s deeply erotic. Daphne Bugey and Fabrice Pellegrin. It’s not their first tango.
She says ""freedom is to be unafraid"".
He has his own motto engraved on the back of his watch, ""carpe diem"", as if to better savour the scandal he created with his partner in crime. Languidly pleasing pleats, round hips and a tiny waist,legs akimbo the up side is down. A handmade scandal. A pink sap courses through this objet, like the life juice of a dangerously irresistible fruit. The design, the drapery, this bottle sets the scene for a story that is meant to be written all through the night and maybe even into day break. Trouble and troubling sensations guaranteed. The color of a grand cru, intensely raspberry, almost bordeaux.
Velvety shades. For a colour that colours the night with couture, sound in two parts: SoScandal! by Jean Paul Gaultier. It’s perfectly clear, and it sounds like a champagne cork explosion.""

A light and fresh yet seductively strong and self-possessed scent, the new Chloe fragrance is in no way its predecessor's timid younger sister. Just like all Chloe's bold, arty and free-spirited designs, the fragrance is feminine in a rather non-traditional, not all-out-girly way. Its accords expertly play against each other and they seduce the audience by being both elegant and daring at the same time. The fragrance is very versatile, it is intended for everyday use and is more than suitable for becoming someone's unique signature scent. Chloe edp was launched in 2008.

Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.
Flacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.

The Notes of Fragrance
Anne Flipo, Béatrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? “It was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness.

Lady Million was launched in 2010. Lady Million was created by Anne Flipo, Beatrice Piquet, Dominique Ropion and Bruno Jovanovic. Top notes are Raspberry, Neroli and Amalfi Lemon; middle notes are Jasmine, African Orange flower and Gardenia; base notes are white honey, Patchouli and Amber. 1 Million is one of the most popular fragrances launched in last several years. After the edition for men, women's version inspired by gold and wealth was expected. Two years after men's edition, fragrant lady finally appears - Lady Million! We can just assume if this lady wants to earn millions or look like a million dollar. It is perfectly clear that the woman represented by this edition radiates, dominates and possesses fiery character with incredible sensuality.
Flacon of Lady Million is in tune with composition and theme of this edition. Instead of gold bullion, the flacon for women is designed as a golden diamond. While insinuating luxury and wealth, the fragrance prepares a surprising composition of intertwined floral, fresh and woody accords. Only diamond can compete with gold, so Lady Million is the perfect companion to modern and masculine 1 Million.

The Notes of Fragrance
Anne Flipo, Béatrice Piquet and Dominque Ropion have all created scents for some of the biggest names in perfumery. But what path did they take to create Lady Million? “It was clear that this perfume had to be as charismatic as 1 Million, with as strong a signature, yet without a direct olfactory link. The Lady Million woman is dazzling, always seductive. This ‘playful’ aspect inspired us immensely. Lady Million is fresh, floral and woody, like a nectar of voluptuous flowers, trailing delicately but still very present. Powerfully seductive, the sparkle of bitter orange with a touch of raspberry reveals the first breath. A burst of neroli follows, smooth and bright. But then the lethal weapon of heady orange blossom slips out of its sheath. Its narcotic sweetness bewitches and grabs all attention. Then, joining with Arabian jasmine underlined by gardenia, the blend soars into something more carnal, yet ever subtle. Now the obsessive pulsing of patchouli enters the fray, pacifying the honey with an addictive and terribly tempting sweetness. Amber spreads to become all enveloping, floating around the beauty, following each movement and offering its most beautiful facets”.
 Designer of the attractive, luxurious flacon is Noe Duchaufour-Lawrance. The perfume will be available as 30, 50 and 80ml edp.

François Demachy, Dior Perfumer-Creator According to the perfumer, this is a fragrance overdosed with carnal woody notes, and it represents a return to the basics: classic and simplicity. It is clear, clean, gentle, and woody but also slightly sweet, and wears like a second skin. The new bottle follows the architectural design of its predecessors, with a more prominent logo and perfume name on the plug. The face of the advertising campaign remains actor Robert Pattinson. Dior Homme is available as a 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with the accompanying grooming line, now available in new packaging.

""I have always located my favourite fragrances at the doorways of kitchens, in the heart of a greenhouse, at the bottom of a garden.

When Mathilde Bijaoui first asked me what my own favourite scent in a bottle might contain, I described a magic potion that I could carry with me wherever I went that would hold for me the fragrance - the spirit - of home. The warm ginger of new baking on a wood table, the immortelle of a fresh spring afternoon, the lazy sunshine of my grandfather's summer greenhouse, woodsmoke and the whisky peat of the Scottish Highlands after rain. I told her about a bottle of spirit, something very simple, to me : something almost indescribable, so personal it should be. The miracle is that Mathilde made it.

If anyone wants to know what ""spirit"" is,

It restores me like the smoke/rain/gingerbread/ greenhouse my scent-sense is fed by. It is a poem about simplicity, about human-scaled miracles. About trust. About home.

This is a new fragrance. Mémoire d’une Odeur was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top notes are Chamomile and Bitter Almond; middle notes are Musk, Indian Jasmine and Jasmine; base notes are Sandalwood, Cedar and Vanilla. “Everything comes from my obsession with scents: my memory is primarily olfactive so, for me, my sense of smell is my memory. I thought that, deep down, perfume is that thing that even with your eyes closed, brings you to a precise moment in space and time. When we began to work on Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur, I tried to imagine the recollection of a scent that couldn’t easily be identified; a hybrid scent that resembles memory as much as possible,” Alessandro Michele.
Scent is in our subconscious, attached to fragments of moments lived, coloring them with emotions of all-consuming joy, of intense love, or overwhelming sadness. A scent can gift a moment again, so an experience from the past can be relived in the now.
For a new Gucci fragrance story, scent becomes an explorer of the power of memories, bringing them back from the past and making them live in our present. Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.
Disrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d’une Odeur.
”The musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,” Alberto Morillas.
“I had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,” Morillas said. “No one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.”
Roman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.
Indian Coral Jasmine Nature Print ® : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.
Alessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.
“The packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn’t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,” Alessandro Michele.
Symbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume’s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto’s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.
“The guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a ‘mythological’ life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren’t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,” Alessandro Michele.
A gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle—a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member’s character and their intimate rapport with one another.
Singer, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Matïss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model). The fragrance is available from August 1st 2019 as a 40m, 60ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, and as a 30ml rollerball bottle.

Skipping backward and forward in chronological time, the present and past are connected by a unique bridge that projects directly into the future. Presenting a new universal Gucci scent. A perfume unassigned with a gender or a time. Presenting Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur is an elixir that transcends gender by its individuality, to establish a new olfactive family, Mineral Aromatic. The transcendent accord features unexpected and enigmatic ingredients, and is defined by a note of Roman chamomile. Alessandro Michele envisioned this particular flower inside the scent, blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s Roman chamomile is structured with Indian Coral Jasmine petals for tenderness, precious musks for depth, and noble woods including warm, luminous sandalwood and airy, subtle cedarwood, a powerful tree with deep roots and an irresistible vanilla note.
Disrupting the traditional olfactive families that classifies fragrances, Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur establishes a new modern fragrance category, Mineral, which is a mix of scents and emotions: airy, musky, transparent and authentic. Mineral was classically used to describe facets of some fragrances, and combined with Aromatic, it becomes the center of Gucci Memoire d’une Odeur.
”The musky mineral accord is the keystone of the fragrance: it links all the other olfactive elements together with pure softness,” Alberto Morillas.
“I had to think quite carefully about why Alessandro chose chamomile. When I started to work with the scent of chamomile itself, then I understood,” Morillas said. “No one had done it before. Chamomile is known all over the world. Everyone has smelt it at some point, but as a dream, a memory of childhood, something timeless, and never in a fragrance. This flower is much underestimated and is a plant with an exceptional olfactive signature.”
Roman Chamomile has grown around Rome in terraced gardens since the 16th and 17th centuries. Giving a green aromatic scent, the sunny and hardy flower has an unparalleled character, radiating with joy to a sweet aromatic dry down with honey and green apple.
Indian Coral Jasmine Nature Print ® : A note exclusive to Gucci, collected in India, the star-shaped flower emits a more powerful scent and colors at night, remaining lighter and fresher during the day. Referred to as Queen of the Night, the official flower of Bengal, this unique quality of jasmine has a honeyed temper and an orangey coral-colored heart.
Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s dry down is an evanescent cloud, evolving on skin with a rhythm of Musks and iconic woods: Cedarwood and Sandalwood. The woody architecture of the fragrance brings intensity to its structure.
Alessandro Michele discovered a vintage Gucci fragrance bottle, and was inspired by its design for Gucci Mémoire d’une Odeur’s bottle. Grooved like a column from an ancient world, the bottle casts a refined silhouette in heavy transparent light green glass, crowned with shiny gold cap. Printed gold foil frames the label, revealing the Gucci logo together with the name of the fragrance.
“The packaging comes from the past, inspired by an old Gucci perfume from the early 90s. I didn’t want the bottle to take on a shape or size that is too feminine or too masculine because the perfume could be very much for women or very much for men,” Alessandro Michele.
Symbolizing a starry night sky and the earthly world that gazes up at it in marvel, the perfume’s green box is decorated with Celestial firmaments inspired by the paintings of Roman and gothic churches of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe. This particular pattern recalls Giotto’s frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova.
“The guiding element of the entire campaign is the idea of freedom; the idea of the non-era, the non-place, the non-social. I pictured a world that was a fresco of a ‘mythological’ life in which the family is a private community with its own social framework where total freedom of expression prevails and where the roles of people and things aren’t clear. I pictured the memory of an authentic memory,” Alessandro Michele.
A gathering of a free-spirited family, who embrace life by living freely and making memories together, an idea by Alessandro Michele. In diverse settings on the outskirts of Rome, the family are captured dancing, picnicking at sun kissed ruins of Canale Monterano, and in and around their family home, Montecalvello Castle—a medieval castle featuring a fountain in a courtyard, and enigmatic frescoes inside and out. Director of the campaign Glen Luchford imbues the video and images with vibrant nostalgia, under the artistic direction of Christopher Simmonds. The print advertising campaign is composed like intimate photo albums, that show each member’s character and their intimate rapport with one another.
Singer, songwriter and actor Harry Styles leads the cast of the family, which includes an eclectic and universal mix of talents and models: Zumi Rosow (designer and musician), Ariana Papademetropoulos (artist), Stanislas Klossowski de Rola (actor and musician), Olimpia Dior (artist), Leslie Winer (model and musician), Thomas Riguelle (model), Tex Santos-Shaw (model), Tessa Bruinsma (model), Olga Zapivokhina (model), Oleg Ulrich (model), Matïss Rucko (model), Mae Lapres (model), William Valente (model), Katea Gramma (model), Unia Pakhomova (model), Ellia Sophia (model), Elibeidy Dani Martinez (model), Cheikh Tall (model), and Aaron Sirainen (model). The fragrance is available from August 1st 2019 as a 40m, 60ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum, and as a 30ml rollerball bottle.

The famous Chanel N°5 is a symbol of good taste and is currently one of the best selling perfumes in the world. Coco Chanel asked the perfume designer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume “which smells like a woman“. Chanel N°5 is a very complex fragrance which does not allow any of the fragrant components to be isolated out of the composition, what was exactly a request of the great Chanel – the perfume should not smell like a rose, or a lily of the valley, but as a composition. The perfume became famous thanks to many celebrities who wore it, among which Marilyn Monroe. Chanel N°5 is often connected to her name because during an interview in 1954 she said that in bed she wore only ‘some drops of Chanel N°5\'. That statement became a superb advertising slogan and a reason for millions of women around the world to choose this perfume. Ernest Beaux created two series of perfume samples numbered 1-5 and 20-24 and asked Coco Chanel to choose one of them. Madame Chanel chose the sample no. 5 and thus the perfume got its name. Superstitious, Chanel presented her new perfume on the fifth day of the fifth month of 1921. Working on creation of this perfume, Ernest Beaux created and for the first time used the synthetic component – aldehydes. In his formula the aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, reminds of the odor of clean linen just brought in the house form the fresh frosty air. It is said that the famous creator drew his inspiration for creation of this fragrance from one of his visits to the Arctic Circle and the smell of water in midnight. The unique smell of frozen lakes and rivers fascinated him so much that he decided to replicate it in his creation. Chanel N°5 is the first perfume in the floral-aldehyde group and the first by the quantity of aldehydes in its composition (another legend says that the Ernest Beaux\'s assistant overdosed the aldehydes in the composition by mistake). The top notes are composed of aldehydes, bergamot, lemon, neroli and ylang-ylang, the heart of jasmine, rose, lily of the valley and iris, while the base is created of vetiver, sandalwood, vanilla, amber and patchouli.

A forbidden shiver rushes over the skin. A substance under strict regulations.Its possession is strictly controlled by law, because heliotropin is used for the chemical synthesis of mda, a prohibited drug and substitute for ecstasy.Confronted with this diabolical indulgence, no one is safe from an olfactory obsession that can soon become a real addiction!"" - a note from the brand.

Carnal Flower was launched in 2005. The nose behind this fragrance is Dominique Ropion. Carnal Flower or forbidden flower is a fragrance with the scent of tuberose. Tuberose is a beautiful and dangerous flower. In some cultures, it is not allowed for young women to feel its intoxicating scent after sunset. Tuberose is a symbol of forbidden pleasure, hiding its passionate, sensual character behind its fresh, white, floral face. Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way. Frederic Malle was inspired for Carnal Flower during his visits to California, where everything smells like gardenia and tuberose. Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention.

Carnal Flower was launched in 2005. The nose behind this fragrance is Dominique Ropion. Carnal Flower or forbidden flower is a fragrance with the scent of tuberose. Tuberose is a beautiful and dangerous flower. In some cultures, it is not allowed for young women to feel its intoxicating scent after sunset. Tuberose is a symbol of forbidden pleasure, hiding its passionate, sensual character behind its fresh, white, floral face. Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way. Frederic Malle was inspired for Carnal Flower during his visits to California, where everything smells like gardenia and tuberose. Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention. The muse for this perfume was Frederic Malle’s aunt, famous actress Candice Bergen, who acted in the movie Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson. The top notes contain: bergamot, melon and eucalyptus.
The middle notes include: ylang-ylang, jasmine, tuberose, Salicylates (natural, toxic product of herbal origin, a sort of a herbal feromone which is used by plants as a warning).

Inspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.
Its flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.
The fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.
The perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.

Hacivat was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Jorge Lee. Top notes are Pineapple, Grapefruit and Bergamot; middle notes are Cedar, Patchouli and Jasmine; base notes are Oakmoss and Woody Notes. “For the collection named as “SHADOW PLAY” launched in 2017, NISHANE has got the main inspiration from the traditional shadow play which is also known as shadow puppetry, an ancient form of storytelling and entertainment which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or scrim. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.
KARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from ""Hacı İvaz"" meaning ""İvaz the Pilgrim""), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece.
The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.

99,Gucci Bloom,"['white floral', 'white floral', 'white floral', 'tuberose', 'tuberose']","Gucci Bloom by Gucci is a Floral fragrance for women. Gucci Bloom was launched in 2017. The nose behind this fragrance is Alberto Morillas. Top note is Jasmine; middle note is Tuberose; base note is Rangoon creeper. Gucci Bloom: Debuting the First Fragrance by Alessandro Michele: “I wanted a green fragrance, a courageous scent that transports you to a vastgarden filled with many flowers and plants, a bouquet of abundance. The garden is as beautiful as women are; colorful, wild, diverse, where there is everything. GucciBloom smells of this garden in order to travel to a place that is not there,” Alessandro Michele. Flowering from the authentic spirit of the women Alessandro Michele champions is an attitude of freedom to be who you want to be. Mixed with the color, decoration and pattern of the creative director’s design canon, the women he dresses are flourishing in a natural, expressive and individual way: they are in bloom. The first Gucci fragrance developed wholly under Alessandro Michele’s creative vision encapsulates this modern philosophy that is the guiding vision for the House.
Gucci Bloom celebrates the authenticity, vitality and diversity of the women he designs for, and those that identify themselves in his vision. True to who they are, these young women experience life and its fruits, blooming into their real selves. They convey their personal point-of-view without conventional limitations. They live for memorable experiences, to create stories and connect and be inspired by the objects, culture and art they choose to be surrounded by. Architect of every element of the scent, Alessandro Michele has infused Gucci Bloom’s idea of lushness, life and vigor in each fragrant note, the dreamy campaign and its unconventional design.
 
ABOUT THE SCENT:  Blended by master perfumer Alberto Morillas with direction from Alessandro Michele, the fragrance is created to unfold like its name. The creative director envisioned the scent as a thriving garden full of diverse types of flowers and the rich perfume it emits.
 
Authenticity is woven through qualitative, highly-concentrated natural ingredients.
Notes blossom out like a concentration of flowers, the unique expression of the new to the world ingredients, brings a new olfactory experience. Natural Tuberose absolute harvested from India is interlaced with natural Jasmine absolute. Jasmine bud extract, obtained through an exclusive method of co-extraction that blends a natural quality of jasmine and captive moleculesto impart a fresh green and petal scent on the skin. Gucci Bloom also features notes of another plant used in perfume-making for the first time, the Rangoon Creeper. Discovered in South India, the Rangoon Creeper embodies the new scent’s concept and name, as it changes color from white, gradually darkens to pink then finally to red when it blooms. The vine’s flowers are redolent with a slightly powdery feminine floral perfume. ABOUT THE DESIGN:  An arbiter and seeker of beauty, Alessandro Michele ideated a flacon and packaging that encapsulates the fragrance’s spirit dedicated to the diversity of women.
 
“The bottle is not designed feminine to seduce men, but to keep company with the women who wear the perfume. Retro and tender because of its color, with clean, slender lines, and not crafted in transparent glass but in porcelain, a material that I love very much,” he said.
 
A vintage powder pink shades the lacquered porcelain square-shaped bottle, appliquéd with the Gucci label ribbed and framed in black. The outer carton is covered inside and outside in Herbarium, a red-and-white toile de Jouy House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers framed in black.
  ABOUT CAMPAIGN:  Encapsulating the very meaning of Gucci Bloom, the campaign’s idea is revealed through the contemporary women of Gucci: actress Dakota Johnson, actress and model Hari Nef and artist Petra Collins. Friends of Alessandro Michele, they have a special connection with the House, their talent resonating with Gucci’s new vision. Their diverse individual beauty is shot by Glen Luchford, allowing them to radiate in the campaign’s transformative setting. They wear Gucci Bloom during their day in the city, and it changes the surrounding urbanity into an imaginary stroll in a fantastical English garden. Tea on a sidewalk flourishing with blooms, walking in an apartment overgrown with verdant plants, and swimming at dusk in a lake entangled with shimmering flowers and reeds.     
 
Dancing, strolling, rejoicing in being free and full of life: this trio embody Gucci’s new vitality and the captivating, transporting nature of Gucci Bloom.
